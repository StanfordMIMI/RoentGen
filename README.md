# RoentGen:  A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Chest X-Ray Generation

RoentGen is a domain-adapted latent diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, text-conditioned chest X-rays (CXRs). This repository contains the code and resources for our paper "[A visionâ€“language foundation model for the generation of realistic chest X-ray images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01246-y)" published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

## Project Overview

RoentGen addresses the challenge of generating realistic medical images by fine-tuning a large, general domain-pre-trained vision-language latent diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) to the medical domain. Our model demonstrates the ability to generate high-fidelity CXRs controllable with on free-form medical text prompts.
